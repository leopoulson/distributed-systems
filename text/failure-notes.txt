- Failure Detection

First we need a way to detect failures.

Let us assume that at first we have the ring topology.
Each node checks that their next node is active. Every T seconds, it sends a message to them.
If they do not get a response in 2D time, several things happen;
* we have to make a new connection to the next one; this is quite hard?
  -> perhaps the nodes send a message to the network, and ask the network to connect them to the next one.
* we broadcast to other nodes that this node is not working.
  -> the network should also be notified.
* we elect a new leader, if necessary.

they broadcast that the
