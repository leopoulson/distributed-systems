- Failure Detection

First we need a way to detect failures.

The failure detection process is as follows. Every T rounds since the last successful FC, a node pings the next one
with a `failure_check` message. When a node receives such a message, they respond with a `failure_response` message
to say that they are indeed active. If no such response is received in 2*d time, then the node sees that the next one
has failed.

If they do not get a response in 2D time, several things happen;
* we have to make a new connection to the next one; this is quite hard?
  -> perhaps the nodes send a message to the network, and ask the network to connect them to the next one.
* we broadcast to other nodes that this node is not working.
  -> the network should also be notified.
* we elect a new leader, if necessary.

- On detection of failure

The node should broadcast to every connected node that this node has failed.

Furthermore, the network needs to re-route the bits around


they broadcast that the node has failed.

- Failure Recovery

We now need to think about how we can recover from a failing node.

We can perform BFS on the system to find the shortest path from one node to another. Now we need to update the nodes
so that they know to forward the messages of a certain type.
